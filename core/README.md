## Development

Most users will want to consume the ABI definitions for Factory and Pool.

This project follows the standard Truffle project structure. 

```
yarn compile   # build artifacts to `build/contracts`
yarn testrpc # run ganache
yarn test    # run the tests
```

Tests can be run verbosely to view approximation diffs:

```
$ yarn test:verbose
```

```
